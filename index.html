<h1>Deceiving and manipulating marketing strategy (source: <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/quantum-solar-system-the-universe-in-your-hands/">Indiegogo</a>)</h1>
<p>"Imagine having a replica of the entire solar system in your home or workplace. With Quantum Solar System (QSS) you can now experience the beauty and wonder of the solar system in your own home."</p>
<p>"Our platform features miniature replica planets that float and orbit around the Sun, all thanks to our innovative magnetic levitation technology. Each planet has been carefully designed to reflect its unique appearance and characteristics, making the experience even more exciting. Plus, our unique design ensures that the planets will always maintain their precise position and orbit around the sun."</p>
<p>"This platform is not only a stunning piece of art, but it is also educational and a great teaching tool for young and old alike. Science lovers and space enthusiasts can enjoy exploring the planets and learning about our solar system in a fascinating and interactive way."</p>
<p>"Quantum Solar System is perfect for anyone interested in astronomy, science, and technology. Take advantage of this unique opportunity and support our project today! With your support, we can bring this incredibly exciting platform to homes and workplaces around the world!."</p>
<p>The positions of the planets are in real time, synchronized with NASA.</p>
<p>You can position the planets at any date: Past, Present or Future. For example, you could observe the position of the planets at any historical date in the past or in any astronomical event of the future.</p>
<p>If you want to observe the evolution of the orbits you can shorten the time, for example you can convert 6 days into 1 second to speed up the movement of the planets.</p>
<p>If you want to relax watching the movement of the planets, you can move all the planets at the same time and at the same speed, in this way all the planets move maintaining their position relative to each other, it is as if the platform rotated on itself.</p>
<p>The Sun is a lamp! Enjoy watching the sunlight illuminating the planets and creating a perfect ambiance.</p>
