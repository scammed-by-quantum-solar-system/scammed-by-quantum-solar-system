<title>Scammed by Quantum Solar System</title>
<body>
  
<h1>Did you get scammed by Quantum Solar System, or Quantum Planets or Quantum Innova?</h1>
<p>Did you trust them with your hard earned money and they delivered nothing in return, except delays, empty promises and abuse?</p>
<p>Are you one of the unfortunate backers who put their trust in this scam project?</p>
<p>Have they lied to you, threatened you, been rude to you, or tried to blackmail you?</p>
<p>If the answer is yes, then you've reached the right place!</p>
<p>They promised to get the "Universe in your hands", but the only thing they are actively working on is getting the money out of your pockets and into their own bank accounts.</p>

<h1>Are you one of the unfortunate backers that trusted them with your hard earned money?</h1>
<p><strong>If so, please join the following <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2050724445413459/">Facebook Group</a> so we can organize and keep in touch!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Or you can join this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantumSolarScam">Reddit sub</a> to keep in touch with latest updates and developments.</strong></p>
<p>Only together we can fight the abusive Quantum Solar System scam!</p>

<h1>Their deceiving and manipulating marketing strategy sounds great on paper</h1>
<ul>
<li>Magnetic Levitation: The core feature is the innovative magnetic levitation technology that allows miniature replica planets to float and orbit around a central "Sun." This creates a "magical and futuristic appearance" without the need for wires or supports.</li>
<li>Real-time & Customizable Planet Positions: The positions of the planets are synchronized with NASA data, reflecting their real-time positions in our solar system. Users can also manually set the planets to any past, present, or future date, allowing for observation of historical astronomical events or future alignments. The movement of the planets can be accelerated (e.g., 6 days into 1 second) to observe orbital evolution more quickly. There's also a "relaxation" mode where all planets move at the same speed, maintaining their relative positions, as if the entire platform were rotating.</li>
<li>Illuminated Sun: The central Sun model functions as a lamp, emitting a pleasant light that illuminates the orbiting planets, creating an ambient atmosphere. An option for a Sun without light is also available.</li>
<li>Detailed Planet Replicas: The planets are exact miniature recreations, with models pulled directly from NASA and hand-painted for lifelike detail.
<li>Intuitive Control App (Android/iOS): Users can connect to the Quantum Solar System via Bluetooth using a dedicated app to customize various aspects, including position of the planets, speed of the orbits, LED lighting, Developer API.</li>
<li>High-Quality Design and Materials: The product is marketed as a "work of art" with a modern and sleek design, built with high-quality materials for durability. The magnetic levitation technology is complex, and assembly is performed manually to ensure precise calibration and a flawless product.</li>
<li>Educational Tool: Beyond being a decorative piece, it's presented as an educational tool for all ages, enabling users to learn about the solar system in an interactive and fascinating way.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Let's take a closer look at facts, and try to see past the lies</h1>
<ul>
<li>They are constantly moving the delivery date for more than 2 years, coming up with new pretexts and vague excuses. Last time they invoked tariffs, now they claim to have "talked" to a factory in Vietnam, offering absolutely no tangible proof or concrete deadlines.</li>
<li>By the time they allegedly plan to start production in Vietnam, the USA tariffs rate for Vietnam will be 46%, which will be a guaranteed excuse for additional delays.</li>
<li>They do not respond to most backers questions and do not attempt to address backers concerns. When they do respond, they provide only vague statements, with no useful content, or they are upfront rude (see the section at the bottom of the page).</li>
<li>They provide regular monthly updates just to comply with Indiegogo's terms, but again, their updates are void of any relevant content. Just look at the dates when the updates have been posted, they are almost always 30 days apart. A real business would have provided ad-hoc updates when something important happens, but they are only providing scheduled updates which means they are only planning them in advance, and nothing business related ever happens. They are well phrased and say what we want to hear, but contain no proof of them actually doing anything to produce the project perks.</li>
<li>The only proof they have for their working project, are 2 years old youtube videos. In the age of AI these might as well be fake, and I think there's a high change that they don't even have a working product.</li>
<li>More recently, they re-enabled Early Bird perks, with the Sun lamp for $499, while some of us paid $749 a year ago. Besides being unfair and making no sense from a business perspective, this seems like a last minute attempt to grab some more cash, before closing up shop. It seems highly unlikely that after 2 years with massive inflation, and huge delays due to financial concerns, the perks would cost so little to produce that they can afford to offer more discounts.</li>
<li>They lied before about production having started, in their March 12th update they said "The moment we've all been waiting for has arrived. We're pleased to inform you that the factory confirms production begins today!". But then they supposedly halted production due to tariffs, and still they have nothing to show as proof. No partial parts being produced or any tangible proof that they actually tried to do something, despite saying otherwise.</li>
<li>And in their April 12th update, exactly one month later, they told us that production was halted indefinitely. So what happened in that month? Did the factory produce anything at all? Or did production stopped so early that they didn’t? If so, why wasn’t there any update? There is just one logical explanation, one hard truth. They never produced anything and they never planned to produce anything. There is no factory in China, there is no factory in Vietnam. It’s just your money, in their pocket, and they are dragging this as long as people still fall for the scam.</li>
<li>Once somebody understands this project is going nowhere and asks for a refund, they say to send an e-mail to support. And support responds with the same copy and paste reply: "Your contribution was made a long time ago, your contribution has already been invested in the production phase and a refund is not possible. But don't worry, when you receive the product you can return it without problems. Thank you for your patience.".</li>
<li>But, this is obviously a lie, as they are getting new backers each week who fall for this scam trap, so that money is certainly not invested. They just don't want to issue refunds, and the only explanation is that they are not planning to build the perks, but keep the money. Plus, they have offered no proof so far of using any of the money to build anything. They have not started production, and at worst, some fraction of the money has been spent on marketing, on making those 2 years old youtube videos that you can just generate with AI. There is no proof of money being invested or used to build any perks at this point, so how can they say that the money has been invested. It's clearly just another lie.</li>
<li>They have a hostile attitude towards backers who are skeptical (for good reason!) of them actually producing anything, after taking more than $600k of our hard earned money. In my conversation with them, their e-mails have been abusive and have even tried to blackmail me to delete my negative comments in exchange for getting a refund. Being so naive, I actually trusted them, so they technically scammed me twice, shame on me! But this just proves to me the type of compulsive liars they are, same as what they're doing with the campaign.</li>

</ul>
<h1>Solid proof that they are a scam</h1>
<ul>
<li>There was another related scam campaign on Indiegogo called Floating Worlds which was reviewed and suspended by Indiegogo: <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/floating-worlds--2/x/4051455#/updates/all">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/floating-worlds--2/x/4051455#/updates/all</a></li></li>
<li>The other campaign is registered under a different user than QSS, they did not ever respond to messages, and also provided vrey few and vague updates, so it looks like a clear scam, despite having almost 200 backers and $40k raised.</li>
<li>The campaign structure also looked very similar to QSS and the team members also supposedly had different names.</li>
<li>But here's the kicker, QSS advertised this other campaign themselves in one of their older updates from August 12th 2024. The other project also has an update which advertised back to QSS.</li>
<li>To me, this is clear, defininitive proof that QSS is also a scam. Please check it out yourselves!</li>
</ul>


<h1>For anybody still considering backing them, please read this first!</h1>
<ul>
<li>Maybe I haven't convinced you, and think I am just am just ranting here against these fine people for no reason. Fair point. But please read this first before doing anything hasty and trusting the thieves with your hard earned money.</li>
<li>Please go to their Indiegogo and Kickstarted pages, and just read the comments from many backers. It's not just me who thinks they are a scam, there are dozens of us, hundreds probably. So please take a few minutes to check the comments and make your own opinion. Best to do this now than regret it later!</li>
<li>If you already pledged recently, but changed your mind, you have 10d to ask for your money back through Indiegogo.</li>
<li>If you've pledged in the last few months, don't despair, you might still be able to ask your bank for a chargeback. Just show them the countless negative comments on their page, the lack of response, the generic e-mails that they are sending when asking for a refund, and your bank should be able to use that as proof and refund your money.</li>
<li>Finally, if you can't get a refund, and can't get a chargeback, then I suggest you join our Facebook group at the top of this page. If there are enough of us, we might eventually be able to get legal representation and press legal charges. It's a long shot, but you don't have anything to lose at this point.
</ul>


<h1>Sharing my story as a cautionary tale</h1>
<p>Because I was just like you one year ago.</p>
<ul>
<li>I saw this wonderful campaign, with a delivery date only 2 months away, perks being offered at 50% off, so I thought that my kids would absolutely love it.</li>
<li>So I pledged $749 for the illuminated solar system. I had previous experience with crowdsourcing, well knowing that delays might happen, so I was not expecting to get it in 2 months. But I did hope it would arrive by Christmas. It did not.</li>
<li>After New Year, I started paying more attention to the updates. The monthly updates never said anything specific, that there are some more delays, and more delays on top.</li>
<li>Then finally, on March 12th, they announced that production has started. I was so happy that the solar system would be ready in time for my kids birthday, even if it was more than one year later from my pledge.</li>
<li>But then, they essentially said that they delayed production indefinitely due to tariffs. That's when I thought something fishy was going on. So I started asking questions.</li>
<li>And I was not satisfied with the answers. I was asking why do they need to halt all production due to tariffs, and why aren't just producing the perks and storing them if US buyers don't want to pay for them, but they only provided superficial replies without actually answering anything. That's when I knew for certain that something is going on, and this started to smell more and more like as scam.</li>
<li>So I asked them for a refund. And they told me to send an email to support, which kindly replied that my money have been invested already. Invested in what? They have not done anything yet, they have no tangible proof of our money being invested in anything. This is when I knew they are taking us for fools. So of course, I started getting angry with them. And started posting more negative comments.</li>
<li>Then they offered a deal, which I initially declined. They said they would refund me if I delete my Indiegogo comments. I did not agree, and I kept posting more comments to make other potential backers aware of the scam. I also created the Facebook group so we can have a safe place where to chat and maybe organize against this scam campaign.</li>
<li>They even attempted and succeeded to get Indiegogo to block my ability to post comments a couple of times, because they claimed that I was harassing them. I also asked Indiegogo to investigate them, and they eventually unblocked my ability to comment. I think Indiegogo might suspect they are a scam, but they turn a blind eye because they make so much money off them.</li>
<li>A few weeks later, they offered me a second deal. They told me that they asked Indiegogo, and they confirmed that they can delete my comments if I request it, and they will refund me afterwards. So I gave in to their despicable manipulation, and asked Indiegogo to remove my comments. I did it in good faith, and I have proof of that.</li>
<li>But of course, they tried to wiggle out of it. After Indiegogo deleted probably 100 of my comments, they found a couple more. So they said that they won't refund me. They also said that I need to close down the Facebook group.</li>
<li>At this point, I realized that I have fallen for their scam the second time. They tricked me into removing my comments, and I will get no refund from them.</li>
<li>So here we are. My story, which is backed by real proof, as I have made all e-mail communication public, is proof of their abuse and manipulation, essentially blackmailing me into removing my comments and absolutely refusing to grant me a refund.</li>
<li>So if you still want to trust them with your hard earned money, I beg you to reconsider. Please, don't be like me a year from now, this scam project is not worth the bother and these people belong in jail for organized fraud, false marketing, manipulation and blackmail.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Major update: they finally refunded my contribution!</h1>

<p>I have one important update to share. After a long three way thread with Indiegogo and QSS, we made the following deal: they are free to delete all my comments from their campaign after they issue my refund (not before).</p>
<p>So, after 1 year of waiting in vain, and almost 2 months of fighting this abusive campaign, the day that I never thought will come finally arrived.</p>
<p>They issued the refund last night, in exchange for agreeing that Indiegogo can delete all my comments from the campaign after the refund is granted.</p>

<h2>Does this mean that the campaign is not a scam?</h2>
<p>No, far from it. I still strongly believe this is just a scam to raise money and deliver nothing in return. The lack of content in their update and replies, all the things they said that just don't add up and don't make sense, stand proof of their duplicity.</p>
<p>They have proved time and time again that they are lying and cannot be trusted, just because they finally issued a refund after almost two months of pressure proves how tight they are holding their money and that they are not willing to let go of them easily.</p>
<p>I sincerely doubt they are planning to deliver the perks, but in the rare event that they do build them, 1y or 2y from now, the way they treat backers and their rude and abusive attitude towards customers speaks for their business. They have proved that they don't care about customers and have no respect for them. I'm sure this would reflect in how they handle further issues such as returns and warranty claims, and that the negative feedback will still follow them, only in a slightly different form.</p>
<p>If they do deliver the perks or offer solid proof that they are actually building them, I will update my third party resources to reflect this as well. I do not aim to twist the truth, but I do want to offer people a chance to not fall for what currently looks like a huge scam.</p>

<h2>What does this mean for other backers?</h2>
<p>As per my "deal" with them, all the third party resources (Facebook Group, Reddit sub, webpage) will remain untouched as they have not been part of the deal terms, I have explicitly mentioned this. These resources will act as a safe place for backers to further talk and organize, and as a word of warning for any new backers that might consider investing their money in this scampaign.</p>
<p>I will continue to monitor the campaign myself, but I will take a more passive role. As I am no longer a backer and I cannot post on their campaign, I will provide any further updates here.</p>

<h2>How can you get your money back?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately I don't have an easy answer to this, I wish I did.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, if you just pledged are now reconsidering, you can ask Indiegogo for a refund directly within the fist 10d.</p>
<p>If you pledged a long time ago, you can still ask your bank for a chargeback. You need specify the initial delivery estimate, offer proof of their refusal to refund you and proof of attempting to communicate with them reasonably. It sounds difficult, but it's actually not. It shouldn't take more than 30 minutes to provide all the required documents.</p>
<p>If none of that works, then last resort is to take matters into your own hands and make your money cost them more than they're worth. That's what I did, and it worked, eventually. But this is not easy, it can be tiresome and stressful, it might take a long time and it might not work in the end. To be honest, if it was just for the money, it's probably not worth it. To me however, it was mostly because of principle, I just absolutely hate being scammed, lied to and taken for a fool.</p>
<p>So I'm not saying to do like I did, but if you do want to pursue this difficult task, I am here to support you. All my resources are at your disposal. The website, the reddit group, I even have copies of my campaign comments which annoyed them so much that they eventually made them refund me. Just say the word, and I will assist you with whatever I can to help get your money back.</p>

<h3>Good luck to everybody, I sincerely hope that you get either your promised perks or your money back!</h3>


<h1>Are you an attorney or do you know one?</h1>
<ul>
<li>I am genuinely interested in getting legal representation for a class action lawsuit.</li>
<li>We do not have money up front, and I am no expert on how this works, but I'm thinking that a lot of us might agree to forfeit 10-20% of the money in exchange for attorney fees, once the lawsuit is one. I, for one, would have no issue with this approach and I think it would be fair for everybody involved.</li>
<li>Remember that the scammers stole $600k, which is not a small amount!</li>
<li>So if you are an attorney and have a proposal, please join our Facebook group at the top of this page.</li>
<li>Update: I was now refunded so this no longer applies to me, but I am sure other backers would be interested.</li>

</ul>

<h1>Meet the team of scammers, expert liars and manipulators</h1>
<p>These might not be their real name, but this is how they present themselves on Kickstarter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walter Schäfer - Research and Development Engineer</li>
<li>Emma Scott - Industrial Designer</li>
<li>Alex Garcia - Software Developer</li>
<li>Kevin Thompson - Project Manager</li>
<li>Emily Taylor - Marketing Specialist</li>
<li>Liam Kim - Production Engineer</li>
</ul>

<p>I also ran a whois search on their website, here is the <a href="https://ph.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?itc=dlp_domain_whois&domain=https%3A%2F%2Fquantumplanets.com%2F&fbclid=IwY2xjawLJyP9leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETE4VUtibnFXazJheHlPVUxiAR6sJXTVazd1iJExmHlLl-mwdLaPdaLq36aWt38QszNe5shLwTwJtTkAU2NtQw_aem_8bU9TWZoy32nvFYSXydZDg">search query on GoDaddy</a></p>
<p>It looks like their website is hosted by a super small ISP from an island in Spain. I do find this rather odd for a supposedly legit business who has raised more than $0.5 million.</p>
<p>The ISP seems to be called "Soluciones Corporativas IP" and has only 6 reviews on google maps, that's how small it is. The address of the ISP is "C/ Menestrals 14, Manacor, Illes Balears, 07500, ES".</p>
<p>Sure, maybe one of the team members had a relative in Spain that had a good deal on web hosting services via their ISP. It is possible, but not very likely.</p>
<p>They claim to be based in Delaware USA, but the fact that they host their webpage via the most obscure service from an island in Spain is another major red flag in my oppinion.</p>
  
<h1>Examples of how Quantum Innova treats their backers</h1>
<p>This is how they patronize and talk down on us when we express concerns or ask valid questions, when they even bother responding:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Jody, once again, what you are saying is untrue and rude. We have respectfully responded to all questions and comments from everyone. QSS has entered production, anyone with a modicum of common sense can see how the tariff war is a very serious global issue. However, bad people are using this opportunity to put more pressure on us and corrupt this community due to their ignorance of product development and all its implications. Please moderate your comments and be respectful. We are all in the same boat, and we all want to have a great product. Thank you."</li>
<li>"Gordon, please read the update. The manufacturing process has already begun with the first phase, so there have been expenses in product development and at the factory. Thank you for your understanding."</li>
<li>"ATM, you’re not a backer, you only donated $1 to comment, with the sole intention of harming the project. Please, we don’t want bad people like you in our community. Don’t bother us, thank you."</li>
<li>"ATM, what you say is not true, videos have already been published showing all the orbits in motion. You have no intention of supporting the project, you only donated $1 to write negative comments, with the sole intention of harming the project. Please, we don’t want bad people like you in our community. Don’t bother us, thank you."</li>
<li>"ATM, please try to understand what you read. We recommend reading the update slowly and trying to understand it. Please be respectful of the community. The situation is critical, not just for us, but for many industries, which are currently experiencing serious difficulties due to the ongoing trade war."</li>
<li>"Sir, the videos you are asking for are on the YouTube channel. Thank you."</li>
<li>"Hi Daniel, please read our latest update."</li>
<li>"Hi Andrew, please read our latest update. Thank you."</li>
<li>"Please read our latest update. Thank you!"</li>
<li>"What you say isn’t true. Only very specific electronic products, such as chips, are excluded. Our product isn’t excluded."</li>
<li>"Adam, please visit our YouTube channel to watch the videos you request."</li>
<li>"Sally, that is not true."</li>
<li>"Spagnoli, support team have already explained you the reasons why your refund isn’t possible. Backer funds are invested in the development of the project, if you don’t agree with that, then you shouldn’t support crowdfunded projects."</li>
<li>"Jody, the tariff war that’s turning the world upside down isn’t exactly a butterfly’s fart, it’s something beyond our control, and also beyond the control of the thousands of affected companies. Long delays in crowdfunding are very common, especially with complex products like ours. If this mechanism doesn’t suit you, our recommendation is that you don’t support crowdfunding projects."</li>
<li>"Jody, honestly, we’re not going to continue a conversation where there’s a lack of respect. Please moderate your tone. Thank you"</li>
<li>"Daniel, support responded to your email. You’re from China and should understand better than anyone how Chinese factories work. They require full payment before beginning the manufacturing process."</li>
<li>"Andrew, please try to understand what you read. If you don’t want copy/paste, we recommend reading the other anwsers and the update slowly and trying to understand it. Please be respectful of the community. The situation is critical, not just for us, but for many industries, which are currently experiencing serious difficulties due to the ongoing trade war."</li>
<li>"Hello Paul, please read our latest update. Thank you."</li>
<li>(e-mail snippet) "Look at the screenshot below, there are still some of your comments left. Delete them."</li>

<h1>I asked Gemini (Google's AI) if Quantum Solar System is legit or a scam</h1>
<p>Question prompt: "What is your opinion on the Quantum Solar System campaign on IndieGoGo? Is this legit or is it a scam? What is the chance that they will ever deliver the promised perks?"</p>
<ul>
<li>The "Quantum Solar System" campaign by QUANTUM INNOVA on IndieGoGo (and also previously on Kickstarter) appears to be a highly controversial and risky project, with a significant number of backers expressing concerns about its legitimacy and the likelihood of delivery.</li>
<li>High skepticism from backers: Many comments from backers across different platforms (IndieGoGo, Kickstarter, forums like Cloudy Nights) explicitly call it a "total scam" and advise others to file chargebacks.</li>
<li>Repeated delays and excuses: Backers complain about nearly two years of delays, various excuses (including tariffs), and a lack of transparent progress. This is a common red flag in crowdfunding.
Lack of tangible progress despite claims: Despite the creators stating they've been showing videos with progress, backers in the comments section disagree, demanding refunds due to a lack of concrete updates.</li>
<li>Questionable financial practices: One comment mentions that Quantum Innova continued to collect pledges at a discounted price even after acknowledging high costs, leading to suspicion that they might cancel the project and keep the funds.</li>
<li>Based on the sentiment and ongoing issues, the chance of them delivering the promised perks appears low to very low.</li>
<li>Track record of non-delivery and broken promises: The consistent complaints about delays, lack of delivery, and demands for refunds indicate a history of not fulfilling their commitments.
Backer frustration and loss of trust: The level of frustration and the explicit calls for chargebacks suggest that many backers have lost faith in the project's ability to deliver.</li>
<li>General crowdfunding risks: IndieGoGo, like Kickstarter, has a success rate that varies, but many projects do fail to deliver. Indiegogo's estimated success rate for campaigns is around 18-30%, which is lower than Kickstarter's. While some tech projects do well, the "Quantum Solar System" project's specific issues raise concerns beyond typical crowdfunding risks.</li>
<li>Comments from early backers: Some comments from people who backed the project almost two years ago are still expressing extreme dissatisfaction, which suggests a long-standing issue with delivery.</li>
<li>While the "Quantum Solar System" concept is intriguing, the available information from backer comments strongly suggests that the campaign by QUANTUM INNOVA is highly questionable and likely a scam. The probability of receiving the promised perks is very low.</li>
<li>Recommendation: If you are considering backing this project, proceed with extreme caution. It's generally advised to be wary of crowdfunding campaigns with excessive delays and poor communication, numerous complaints from existing backers about non-delivery or lack of progress, vague excuses for delays or changes in plans, unrealistic claims or promises that seem too good to be true</li>
<li>It would be prudent to avoid pledging any money to this campaign, and if you have already, consider exploring options for a chargeback through your credit card company or payment provider.</li>
