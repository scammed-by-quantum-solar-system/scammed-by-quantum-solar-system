<title>Scammed by Quantum Solar System</title>
<body>
  
<h1>Did you get scammed by Quantum Solar System, or Quantum Planets?</h1>
<p>If so, you've reached the right place!</p>

<h1>Are you one of the unfortunate backers that trusted them with your hard earned money?</h1>
<strong>If so, please join the following <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2050724445413459/">Facebook Group</a></strong>
<p>Together we can try to fight this abusive campaign!</p>

<h1>Their deceiving and manipulating marketing strategy sounds great on paper</h1>
<ul>
<li>Magnetic Levitation: The core feature is the innovative magnetic levitation technology that allows miniature replica planets to float and orbit around a central "Sun." This creates a "magical and futuristic appearance" without the need for wires or supports.</li>
<li>Real-time & Customizable Planet Positions: The positions of the planets are synchronized with NASA data, reflecting their real-time positions in our solar system. Users can also manually set the planets to any past, present, or future date, allowing for observation of historical astronomical events or future alignments. The movement of the planets can be accelerated (e.g., 6 days into 1 second) to observe orbital evolution more quickly. There's also a "relaxation" mode where all planets move at the same speed, maintaining their relative positions, as if the entire platform were rotating.</li>
<li>Illuminated Sun: The central Sun model functions as a lamp, emitting a pleasant light that illuminates the orbiting planets, creating an ambient atmosphere. An option for a Sun without light is also available.</li>
<li>Detailed Planet Replicas: The planets are exact miniature recreations, with models pulled directly from NASA and hand-painted for lifelike detail.
<li>Intuitive Control App (Android/iOS): Users can connect to the Quantum Solar System via Bluetooth using a dedicated app to customize various aspects, including position of the planets, speed of the orbits, LED lighting, Developer API.</li>
<li>High-Quality Design and Materials: The product is marketed as a "work of art" with a modern and sleek design, built with high-quality materials for durability. The magnetic levitation technology is complex, and assembly is performed manually to ensure precise calibration and a flawless product.</li>
<li>Educational Tool: Beyond being a decorative piece, it's presented as an educational tool for all ages, enabling users to learn about the solar system in an interactive and fascinating way.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Let's take a closer look at facts, and try to see past the lies</h1>
<ul>
<li>They are constantly moving the delivery date for more than 2 years, coming up with new pretexes and vague excuses. Last time they invoked tarriffs, now they claim to have "talked" to a factory in Vietnam, offering absolutely no tangible proof or concrete deadlines.</li>
<li>They do not respond to most backers questions and do not attempt to address backers concerns. When they do respond, they provide only vague statements, with no useful content.</li>
<li>They provide regular montly updates just to comply with Indiegogo's terms, but again, their updates are void of any relevat content. Just look at the dates when the updates have been posted, they are almost always 30 days apart. A real business would have provided ad-hoc updates when something important happens, but they are only providing scheduled updates which means they are planning them in advance. They are well phrased and say what we want to hear, but contain no proof of them actually doing anything to produce the project perks.</li>
<li>The only proof they have for their working project, are 2 years old youtube videos. In the age of AI these might as well be fake, and I think there's a high change that they don't even have a working product.</li>
<li>More recently, they re-enabled Early Bird perks, with the Sun lamp for $499, while some of us paid $749 a year ago. Besides being unfair and making no sense from a business perspective, this seems like a last minute attempt to grab some more cash, before closing up shop.</li>
<li>They lied before about production having started, in their March 12th update they said "The moment we've all been waiting for has arrived. We're pleased to inform you that the factory confirms production begins today!". But then they halted production due to tarrifs, and still they have nothing to show as proof. No partial parts being produced or any tangible proof that they actually tried to do something.</li>
<li>If soomebody asks for a refund, they tell them to send en e-mail to their "support@quantumplanets.com" address. Then, they offer everybody the same copy paste replies about money being already invested, clearly not the case since production has not even started.</li>
<li>They have a hostile attitude towards backers who are skeptical of them actually producting anything, after taking more than $600k of our hard earned money. In my conversation with them, their e-mails have been abusive and have even tried to blackmail me to delete my negative comments in exchange for getting a refund. Being so naive, I actually truseted them, so they technically scammed me twice, shame on me! But this just proves to me the type of liars they are, they are not keeping their word and are constantly lying, same as what they're doing with the campaign.</li>
</ul>


<h1>For anybody considering backing them, please read this first!</h1>
<ul>
<li>Maybe I haven't convinced you, and think I am just am just ranting here against these fine people for no reason. Fair point. But please read this first before doing anything hasty and trusting the thieves with your hard earned money.</li>
<li>Please go to their Indiegogo and Kickstarted pages, and just read the comments from many backers. It's not just me who thinks they are a scam, there are dozens of us. So please take a few minuts to check the comemmnts and make your own oppinion.</li>
<li>If you already pledged recently, but changed your mind, you have 10d to ask for your money back through Indiegogo.</li>
<li>If you've pledged in the last few months, don't dispair, you might still be able to ask your bank for a chargeback. Just show them the countless negative comments on their page, the lack of response, the generic e-mails that they are sending when asking for a refund, and your bank should be able to use that as proof and refund your money.</li>
<li>Finally, if you can't get a refund, and can't get a chargeback, then I suggest you join our Facebook group at the top of this page. If there are enough of us, we might eventually be able to get legal representation and press legal charges. It's a long shot, but you don't have anything to lose at this point.
</ul>


<h1>Are you an attorney or do you know one?</h1>
<ul>
<li>I am genunely interested in getting legal representation for a class action lawsuit.</li>
<li>We do not have money up front, and I am no expert on how this works, but I'm thinking that a lot of us might agree to forfeit 10-20% of the money in exchange for attorney fees, once the lawsuit is one. I, for one, would have no issue with this approach and I think it would be fair for everybody involved.</li>
<li>So if you are an attorney and have a proposal, please join our Facebook group at the top of this page.</li>
