<h1>Did you get scammed by Quantum Solar System, or Quantum Planets?</h1>
<p>If so, you've reached the right place!</p>

<h1>Are you one of the unfortunate backers that trusted them with your hard earned money?</h1>
<strong>If so, please join the following <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2050724445413459/">Facebook Group</a></strong>
<p>Together we can try to fight this abusive campaign!</p>

<h1>Their deceiving and manipulating marketing strategy sounds great on paper</h1>
<ul>
<li>Magnetic Levitation: The core feature is the innovative magnetic levitation technology that allows miniature replica planets to float and orbit around a central "Sun." This creates a "magical and futuristic appearance" without the need for wires or supports.</li>
<li>Real-time & Customizable Planet Positions: The positions of the planets are synchronized with NASA data, reflecting their real-time positions in our solar system. Users can also manually set the planets to any past, present, or future date, allowing for observation of historical astronomical events or future alignments. The movement of the planets can be accelerated (e.g., 6 days into 1 second) to observe orbital evolution more quickly. There's also a "relaxation" mode where all planets move at the same speed, maintaining their relative positions, as if the entire platform were rotating.</li>
<li>Illuminated Sun: The central Sun model functions as a lamp, emitting a pleasant light that illuminates the orbiting planets, creating an ambient atmosphere. An option for a Sun without light is also available.</li>
<li>Detailed Planet Replicas: The planets are exact miniature recreations, with models pulled directly from NASA and hand-painted for lifelike detail.
<li>Intuitive Control App (Android/iOS): Users can connect to the Quantum Solar System via Bluetooth using a dedicated app to customize various aspects, including position of the planets, speed of the orbits, LED lighting, Developer API.</li>
<li>High-Quality Design and Materials: The product is marketed as a "work of art" with a modern and sleek design, built with high-quality materials for durability. The magnetic levitation technology is complex, and assembly is performed manually to ensure precise calibration and a flawless product.</li>
<li>Educational Tool: Beyond being a decorative piece, it's presented as an educational tool for all ages, enabling users to learn about the solar system in an interactive and fascinating way.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Let's take a closer look at facts, and try to see past the lies</h1>
<ul>
<li>They are constantly moving the delivery date for more than 2 years, coming up with new pretexes and vague excuses. Last time they invoked tarriffs, now they claim to have "talked" to a factory in Vietnam, offering absolutely no tangible proof or concrete deadlines.</li>
<li>They do not respond to most backers questions and do not attempt to address backers concerns. When they do respond, they provide only vague statements, with no useful content.</li>
<li>They provide regular montly updates just to comply with Indiegogo's terms, but again, their updates are void of any relevat content. Just look at the dates when the updates have been posted, they are almost always 30 days apart. A real business would have provided ad-hoc updates when something important happens, but they are only providing scheduled updates which means they are planning them in advance. They are well phrased and say what we want to hear, but contain no proof of them actually doing anything to produce the project perks.</li>
<li>The only proof they have for their working project, are 2 years old youtube videos. In the age of AI these might as well be fake, and I think there's a high change that they don't even have a working product.</li>
<li>More recently, they re-enabled Early Bird perks, with the Sun lamp for $499, while some of us paid $749 a year ago. Besides being unfair and making no sense from a business perspective, this seems like a last minute attempt to grab some more cash, before closing up shop. It seems highly unlikely that after 2 years with massive inflation, and massive delays due to financial concerns, the perks would cost so little to produce that they can afford to offer more discounts.</li>
<li>They lied before about production having started, in their March 12th update they said "The moment we've all been waiting for has arrived. We're pleased to inform you that the factory confirms production begins today!". But then they halted production due to tarrifs, and still they have nothing to show as proof. No partial parts being produced or any tangible proof that they actually tried to do something.</li>
<li>If soomebody asks for a refund, they tell them to send en e-mail to their "support@quantumplanets.com" address. Then, they offer everybody the same copy paste replies about money being already invested, clearly not the case since production has not even started.</li>
<li>They have a hostile attitude towards backers who are skeptical of them actually producting anything, after taking more than $600k of our hard earned money. In my conversation with them, their e-mails have been abusive and have even tried to blackmail me to delete my negative comments in exchange for getting a refund. Being so naive, I actually truseted them, so they technically scammed me twice, shame on me! But this just proves to me the type of liars they are, they are not keeping their word and are constantly lying, same as what they're doing with the campaign.</li>
</ul>


<h1>For anybody considering backing them, please read this first!</h1>
<ul>
<li>Maybe I haven't convinced you, and think I am just am just ranting here against these fine people for no reason. Fair point. But please read this first before doing anything hasty and trusting the thieves with your hard earned money.</li>
<li>Please go to their Indiegogo and Kickstarted pages, and just read the comments from many backers. It's not just me who thinks they are a scam, there are dozens of us. So please take a few minuts to check the comemmnts and make your own oppinion.</li>
<li>If you already pledged recently, but changed your mind, you have 10d to ask for your money back through Indiegogo.</li>
<li>If you've pledged in the last few months, don't dispair, you might still be able to ask your bank for a chargeback. Just show them the countless negative comments on their page, the lack of response, the generic e-mails that they are sending when asking for a refund, and your bank should be able to use that as proof and refund your money.</li>
<li>Finally, if you can't get a refund, and can't get a chargeback, then I suggest you join our Facebook group at the top of this page. If there are enough of us, we might eventually be able to get legal representation and press legal charges. It's a long shot, but you don't have anything to lose at this point.

<h1>Sharing my story as a cautionary tale</h1>
<ul>
<li>I was like you one year ago. I saw this campaign, with a delivery date only 2 months away, perks being offered at 50% off, so I thought that my kids would absolutely love it.</li>
<li>So I pleged $749 for the illuminated solar system. I had previous experience with crowdsourcing, well knowing that delays might happen, so I was not expecting to get it in 2 months. But I did hope it would arrive by Christmas. It did not.</li>
<li>After New Year, I started paying more attention to the updates. The montly updates never said anything specific, that there are some more delays, and more delays on top.</li>
<li>Then finally, on March 12th, they announced that production has started. I was so happy that the solar system would be ready in time for my kids birthday, even if it was more than one year later from my pledge.<li>
<li>But then, they said that they delayed production indefinately due to tarrifs. That's when I thought something fishy was going on. So I started asking questions.</li>
<li>And I was not satisfied with the answears. I was asking why do they need to halt all production due to tarrifs, and why aren't just producting the perks and storing them if US buyers don't want to pay for them, but they only provided superficial replies without actually answearing anything. That's when I knew for certain that something is going on, and this started to smell more and more like as scam.</li>
<li>So I asked them for a refund. And they told me to send an email to support, which kindly replied that my money have been invested already. Invested in what? They have not done anything yet, they have no tangible proof of our money being invested in anything. This is when I knew they are taking us for fools. So of course, I started getting angry with them. And started posting more negative comments.</li>
<li>Then they offered a deal, which I initially declined. They said they would refund me if I delete my Indiegogo comments. I did not agree, and I kept posting more comments to make other potential backers aware of the scam. I also created the Facebook group so we can have a safe place where to chat and maybe organize against this scam campaign.</li>
<li>A few weeks later, they offered me a deal. They told me that they asked Indiegogo, and they confirmed that they can delete my comments if I request it, and they will refund me aftwerwards. So I gave in to their despicable manipulation, and asked Indiegogo to remove my comments. I did it in good faith, and I have proof of that.</li>
<li>But of course, they tried to wiggle out of it. After Indiegogo deleted probably 100 of my comments, they found a couple more. So they said that they won't refund me. They also said that I need to close down the Facebook group.</li>
<li>At this point, I realized that I have fallen for their scam the second time. They tricked me into removing my comments, and I will get no refund from them.</li>
<li>So here we are. My story, which is backed by real proof, as I have made all e-mail communication public, is proof of their abuse and manipulation, essientially blackmailing me into removing my comments and absolutely refusing to grant me a refund.</li>
<li>You can find all my email communication with them here: <a href="https://postimg.cc/gallery/GbRvxCv">https://postimg.cc/gallery/GbRvxCv</a></li>
<li>So if you still want to trust them with your hard earned money, I beg you to reconsider. Please, don't be like me a year from now, this scam project is not worth the bother and these people belong in jail for organized fraud, false marketing, manipulation and blackmail.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Are you an attorney or do you know one?</h1>
<ul>
<li>I am genunely interested in getting legal representation for a class action lawsuit.</li>
<li>We do not have money up front, and I am no expert on how this works, but I'm thinking that a lot of us might agree to forfeit 10-20% of the money in exchange for attorney fees, once the lawsuit is one. I, for one, would have no issue with this approach and I think it would be fair for everybody involved.</li>
<li>So if you are an attorney and have a proposal, please join our Facebook group at the top of this page.</li>

<h1>I asked Gemini (Google's AI) if Quantum Solar System is legit or a scam</h1>
<ul>
<li>Question prompt: "What is your opinion on the Quantum Solar System campaign on IndieGoGo? Is this legit or is it a scam? What is the chance that they will ever deliver the promised perks?"</li>
<li>The "Quantum Solar System" campaign by QUANTUM INNOVA on IndieGoGo (and also previously on Kickstarter) appears to be a highly controversial and risky project, with a significant number of backers expressing concerns about its legitimacy and the likelihood of delivery.</li>
<li>High skepticism from backers: Many comments from backers across different platforms (IndieGoGo, Kickstarter, forums like Cloudy Nights) explicitly call it a "total scam" and advise others to file chargebacks.</li>
<li>Repeated delays and excuses: Backers complain about nearly two years of delays, various excuses (including tariffs), and a lack of transparent progress. This is a common red flag in crowdfunding.
Lack of tangible progress despite claims: Despite the creators stating they've been showing videos with progress, backers in the comments section disagree, demanding refunds due to a lack of concrete updates.</li>
<li>Questionable financial practices: One comment mentions that Quantum Innova continued to collect pledges at a discounted price even after acknowledging high costs, leading to suspicion that they might cancel the project and keep the funds.</li>
<li>Based on the sentiment and ongoing issues, the chance of them delivering the promised perks appears low to very low.</li>
<li>Track record of non-delivery and broken promises: The consistent complaints about delays, lack of delivery, and demands for refunds indicate a history of not fulfilling their commitments.
Backer frustration and loss of trust: The level of frustration and the explicit calls for chargebacks suggest that many backers have lost faith in the project's ability to deliver.</li>
<li>General crowdfunding risks: IndieGoGo, like Kickstarter, has a success rate that varies, but many projects do fail to deliver. Indiegogo's estimated success rate for campaigns is around 18-30%, which is lower than Kickstarter's. While some tech projects do well, the "Quantum Solar System" project's specific issues raise concerns beyond typical crowdfunding risks.</li>
<li>Comments from early backers: Some comments from people who backed the project almost two years ago are still expressing extreme dissatisfaction, which suggests a long-standing issue with delivery.</li>
<li>While the "Quantum Solar System" concept is intriguing, the available information from backer comments strongly suggests that the campaign by QUANTUM INNOVA is highly questionable and likely a scam. The probability of receiving the promised perks is very low.</li>
<li>Recommendation: If you are considering backing this project, proceed with extreme caution. It's generally advised to be wary of crowdfunding campaigns with excessive delays and poor communication, numerous complaints from existing backers about non-delivery or lack of progress, vague excuses for delays or changes in plans, unrealistic claims or promises that seem too good to be true</li>
<li>It would be prudent to avoid pledging any money to this campaign, and if you have already, consider exploring options for a chargeback through your credit card company or payment provider.</li>
