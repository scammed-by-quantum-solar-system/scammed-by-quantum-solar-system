<h1>Their deceiving and manipulating marketing strategy sounds great on paper</h1>
<ul>
<li>Magnetic Levitation: The core feature is the innovative magnetic levitation technology that allows miniature replica planets to float and orbit around a central "Sun." This creates a "magical and futuristic appearance" without the need for wires or supports.</li>
<li>Real-time & Customizable Planet Positions: The positions of the planets are synchronized with NASA data, reflecting their real-time positions in our solar system. Users can also manually set the planets to any past, present, or future date, allowing for observation of historical astronomical events or future alignments. The movement of the planets can be accelerated (e.g., 6 days into 1 second) to observe orbital evolution more quickly. There's also a "relaxation" mode where all planets move at the same speed, maintaining their relative positions, as if the entire platform were rotating.</li>
<li>Illuminated Sun: The central Sun model functions as a lamp, emitting a pleasant light that illuminates the orbiting planets, creating an ambient atmosphere. An option for a Sun without light is also available.</li>
<li>Detailed Planet Replicas: The planets are exact miniature recreations, with models pulled directly from NASA and hand-painted for lifelike detail.
<li>Intuitive Control App (Android/iOS): Users can connect to the Quantum Solar System via Bluetooth using a dedicated app to customize various aspects, including position of the planets, speed of the orbits, LED lighting, Developer API.</li>
<li>High-Quality Design and Materials: The product is marketed as a "work of art" with a modern and sleek design, built with high-quality materials for durability. The magnetic levitation technology is complex, and assembly is performed manually to ensure precise calibration and a flawless product.</li>
<li>Educational Tool: Beyond being a decorative piece, it's presented as an educational tool for all ages, enabling users to learn about the solar system in an interactive and fascinating way.</li>
